Installing from git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A script

./bootstrap.sh

is available. (Re)running this script copies/generates the necessary
files, so you can continue with the "Installing from tarball" section.

You need the following tools to be able to do this step:

libtoolize 2.4
aclocal    1.11.1
autoheader 2.68
automake   1.11.1
autoconf   2.68

(This means libtoolize 2.4, automake 1.11.1 and autoconf 2.68 packages)

If you are trying to build from an earlyer revision, you either have to
issue these commands properly by hand, or grab the mkbuildenv script
from the revision mentioned above.

Installing from tarball
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to be able to build from the sources, you will need GNU make
version 3.81, and a build system for the linux kernel module. Such a
build system is often provided by some sort of kernel-headers package
in your distribution.

To compile the kernel module, the library and the binaries, unpack the
archive, cd into the source directory, and do the following:

./configure
make
sudo make install

To install with debugging enabled, use the with-debug option with
configure:

./configure --with-debug

The install script installs the following items:

* bdtun kernel module (bdtun.ko)
* bdtun header file (bdtun.h)
* shared library (bdtun.so.x.x.x)
* command line tool for setting up tunnels (bdtun)
* bdtun loopback client for testing / debugging (bdtunloop)
