Installing bdtun

To install bdtun do the following:

cd bdtun # make bdtun directory current
make
make install

To install with debugging enabled:

cd bdtun
make DEBUG=y
make install

The install script installs the following items:

bdtun kernel module (use "modprobe bdtun" to load it)
/usr/local/lib/libbdtun.so, shared library
/usr/local/bin/bdtun, command line interface

During make, a test client binary "testclient" is built,
but it is not installed anywhere. You can find it in
the bdtun directory.
