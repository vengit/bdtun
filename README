What is BDTun?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BDTun is a tool for writing block device drivers in userspace.

See the doc directory and the bdtunloop sources for documentation on how
to write such drivers.

How does it work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The kernel module sets up a character device at /dev/bdtun. The command
line tool and/or the user space driver can communicate through this
device.

One can set up, list, show info on and remove device with commands sent
through this device file.

A create command sets up a block and a character device called a device
pair. The device pair will have names /dev/name and /dev/name_tun, where
name is chosen arbitrarily. The user space driver (called a client)
opens the character device (one with the _tun at the end of it's name)
and reads commands from it. When it completes the command, it also
writes the result to this device.

The block device end of a device pair can be used for whatever a block
device can be: it can host partitions or be formatted raw, used as a pv
of an LVM array and so on.

What's in the package?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BDTun comes with a kernel module, a command line tool to set up tunnels,
a header file and a library file. See INSTALL for details.

How do I install it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation follows the usual configure - make - make install process.
You need kernel headers, gnu make, and gcc to build it.

In order to build from git, you have to use libtool, autotools and
automake to set up the build environment.

See INSTALL for the exact details.

How do I contribute?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
